        question: "How is Alacrity different from other agencies?",
        answer:
            "We don't just design pretty pages — we build systems that generate revenue. Every project is backed by data, automation, and a clear focus on ROI. We combine AI tools with real engineering to deliver results, not just deliverables.",

    {
        question: "How long does a typical project take?",
        answer:
            "Starter projects (landing pages, single-page sites) launch in about 2 weeks. Growth packages typically ship in 4 to 6 weeks. Enterprise solutions are scoped individually. We move fast without cutting corners.",

    {
        question: "Do you work with startups or only established businesses?",
        answer:
            "Both. We work with ambitious startups building their first MVP, as well as established brands looking to automate and scale. If you're serious about growth, we're the right fit.",

            "Our stack includes Next.js, React, Node.js, Python, Flutter, and cloud platforms like AWS and Vercel. For AI, we work with OpenAI, LangChain, and custom solutions. We pick the right tool for each project — no one-size-fits-all.",
    },
    {
        question: "What's included in post-launch support?",
        answer:

    },
    {
        question: "Can you integrate with our existing tools?",
        answer:
            "Yes. We specialise in integrations — CRM systems, payment gateways, marketing platforms, custom APIs, and more. If it has an API, we can connect it.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm not happy with the design?",
        answer:
            "We build in revision rounds for every project. You'll see progress at every stage and have the opportunity to give feedback. Our goal is a result you're genuinely proud of.",
    },
